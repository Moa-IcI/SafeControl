### App Idea: "Safe Control: Parental control made easy."  

Parental control that if you pay certain amount of money the parental control will cease to function.  
Main functions:  
* App time limit.
* Block Phone access after certain time.
* Allow certain apps after phone blockage.
* Allow emergency calls after block (unlike [Family Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink&hl=en_US&gl=US)).
* Live location.

This app will not be ported to IPhone cuz I'm too lazy to learn Swift and don't care about the rich, spoiled kids.  
If you know Swift do a commit and i will check on it.
