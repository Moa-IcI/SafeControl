### App Idea: "Safe Control: Parental control made easy."  

Parental control that if you pay certain amount of money the parental control will cease to function.  
Main functions:  
* App time limit.
* Block Phone access after certain time.
* Allow certain apps after phone blockage.
* Allow infinite calls after block (unlike [Family Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink&hl=en_US&gl=US)).
* Live location.

If the user gets the backdoor he can:
* Interrupt the live location/falsify the location.
* Remove all time limits and set a fake "time used".
* Cancel all blockages.
This app will not be ported to IPhone cuz I'm too lazy to learn Swift and don't care about the rich, spoiled kids.  
If you know Swift do a commit and i will check on it.
